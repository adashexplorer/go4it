## 🧭 Overview  
**Go4it** is my personal space for learning and experimenting with the **Go programming language**.  
From understanding Go’s core syntax and idioms to building mini projects, this repo documents my entire journey — the *mistakes, experiments, and wins* — as I explore the world of GoLang.  

Whether you’re just starting out or brushing up on concurrency, you’ll find organized examples, notes, and small projects here.

## 🧭 Go Mastery Roadmap (Complete 2025 Edition)

### 🪄 1. Core Language
✅ Variables, Constants, Data Types  
✅ Control structures (`if`, `switch`, `for`)  
✅ Functions, Closures, Higher-order funcs  
✅ Structs & Embedding  
✅ Interfaces & Polymorphism  
✅ Pointers & Memory model  
✅ Error handling (`error`, `panic`, `recover`)

💡 **Interview Focus:**
> - How does Go handle multiple return values?  
> - What’s the zero value of a variable?  
> - When should you use `panic` vs `error`?

---

### ⚙️ 2. Collections & Built-ins
- Arrays, Slices, Maps  
- Capacity management and append growth  
- Copy vs reference semantics  
- `make`, `new`, and allocation patterns  
- Deep vs shallow copies  
- Iteration patterns and performance  

💡 **Interview Focus:**
> - What happens when you append to a nil slice?  
> - How are maps implemented internally?

---

### 🚀 3. Concurrency & Parallelism (Go’s Superpower)
- Goroutines & Go Scheduler (M:N model)
- Channels (unbuffered, buffered, directional)
- Select statement  
- WaitGroups, Mutex, RWMutex  
- Once, Cond, Atomic operations  
- Context propagation and cancellation  
- Worker pools, Rate limiters  
- Pipelines and Fan-In/Fan-Out  
- Deadlocks, Race detection  
- Channel-based vs Lock-based synchronization  

💡 **Interview Focus:**
> - Explain how Go’s scheduler works.  
> - How do channels prevent race conditions?  
> - Implement a worker pool.

---

### 🧩 4. Memory & Performance Engineering
- Escape analysis (stack vs heap allocation)
- Garbage Collector internals  
- Profiling tools: `pprof`, `trace`, `memstats`  
- Inlining, stack growth, and frame size  
- Benchmarking (`go test -bench`)  
- Optimizing for memory locality  
- CPU & memory optimization patterns  
- Understanding GOMAXPROCS & runtime tuning  

---

### 🧱 5. Go Modules & Dependency Management
- Semantic Import Versioning (v2+ rules)  
- Replace & Exclude directives  
- Private modules  
- Vendoring (`go mod vendor`)  
- Multi-module repositories  
- Reproducible builds  

💡 **Interview Focus:**
> - What’s the purpose of `go.mod` and `go.sum`?  
> - How would you manage dependencies in production?

---

### 🌐 6. Networking, Web, and APIs
- `net/http` deep dive (ServeMux, handlers)  
- Context usage in handlers  
- Middleware chains  
- Graceful shutdowns  
- gRPC & Protobuf  
- REST design best practices  
- WebSocket handling  
- Rate limiting, retries, and circuit breakers  

💡 **Frameworks:** Gin • Echo • Fiber

---

### 🗃️ 7. Databases, Storage & I/O
- `database/sql` (connection pooling, prepared statements)
- ORM frameworks (GORM, SQLX)
- File handling (`os`, `io`, `bufio`, `ioutil`)

- Transactions, locks, and isolation  

---

### 🧠 8. Advanced Go Concepts
- Reflection & Type introspection (`reflect`)
- `unsafe` package (for understanding, not daily use)
- Generics & Type parameters (Go 1.18+)
- Custom type constraints  
- Type assertions vs Type switches  
- Interface internals (itab, method tables)
- Embedding interfaces  
- Package init order  
- Go plugin system (`plugin` pkg)

---

### 🧰 9. Tooling & Ecosystem
